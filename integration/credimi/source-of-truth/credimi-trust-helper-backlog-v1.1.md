# Credimi Trust Helper Backlog v0.2

This backlog supports the human-readable evidence-claim model introduced in
`credimi-conformance-evidence-registry-v0.4.yaml`.

## Key vocabulary change

Previous draft language:

```text
W-PROT-ISS-01
CRED-WALLET-ISS-001
```

New product language:

```text
Evidence claim: Wallet receives PID/EAA issuance request
Slug: wallet-receives-pid-eaa-issuance-request
Internal ID: credimi.evidence.wallet.issuance.receives_pid_eaa_request.v1
```

The helper should emit results against `slug` and `internal_id`, while the UI should primarily show `title`.

---

## 1. Architecture decision

Build the trust helper first as a **Go library + CLI**, then expose it as a service only if needed.

Recommended shape:

```text
credimi-trust-helper
├── cmd/credimi-trust-helper
├── pkg/fetch
├── pkg/schema
├── pkg/signature
├── pkg/x509
├── pkg/revocation
├── pkg/register
├── pkg/entitlement
├── pkg/fixtures
└── pkg/report
```

The CLI should be callable from StepCI/YAML or from a Credimi pipeline helper step.

Example:

```sh
credimi-trust-helper check-rp-request \
  --presentation-request presentation-request.json \
  --rp-register-url https://... \
  --lotl-url https://... \
  --out trust-result.json
```

---

## 2. Output contract

Every helper command should emit JSON with this common envelope:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.2",
  "claim_slug": "rp-requested-attributes-match-entitlements",
  "claim_title": "Relying Party requests only registered attributes",
  "internal_id": "credimi.evidence.rp.entitlement.requested_attributes_match_entitlements.v1",
  "result": "pass",
  "subject": {
    "actor_type": "relying_party",
    "identifier": "example-rp-id"
  },
  "checks": [
    {
      "id": "register_entry_present",
      "title": "Register entry is present",
      "result": "pass",
      "evidence": ["register-response.json"]
    }
  ],
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "register_response",
      "ref": "register-response.json",
      "sha256": "..."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": []
}
```

Result enum:

```text
pass
fail
warning
partial
not_tested
manual_review
inconclusive
```

---

## 3. Priority 1 — Normalized evidence layer

### B-001 — Generate `conformance_result.json`

Goal: derive a normalized, reviewer-facing evidence result from raw Temporal/StepCI/Maestro outputs.

Inputs:

- Temporal input
- Temporal output
- step-level input/output
- screenshots
- videos
- external test results
- evidence claim slugs / internal IDs

Outputs:

- `conformance_result.json`
- optional `hash_manifest.json`
- optional PDF report later

Important:

- The UI should show `title`.
- URLs/filters should use `slug`.
- APIs/database references may use `internal_id`.

### B-002 — Add evidence claim mappings to pipeline/action definitions

Allow action definitions to declare:

```yaml
conformance:
  evidence_contributions:
    - slug: wallet-receives-pid-eaa-issuance-request
      internal_id: credimi.evidence.wallet.issuance.receives_pid_eaa_request.v1
      contribution_level: partial
      evidence_type:
        - behavioral_black_box
```

For full pipeline profiles:

```yaml
conformance:
  profile_slug: wallet-protocols-and-user-flow
  expected_claims:
    - wallet-receives-pid-eaa-issuance-request
    - wallet-completes-pid-eaa-issuance
```

### B-003 — Hash manifest

Create hashes for:

- Temporal input/output
- step input/output
- videos
- screenshots
- metadata snapshots
- external conformance test outputs

Output:

```json
{
  "algorithm": "sha256",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "ref": "temporal-output.json",
      "sha256": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### B-010 — External result adapter

Inputs:

- OpenID Foundation conformance output
- WE BUILD test output
- headless Wallet test output

Outputs:

- raw external output stored unchanged

### B-011 — Assertion mapping file

Example:

```yaml
external_suite: openid-conformance
external_test_id: openid4vp-response-mode-direct-post-jwt
maps_to:
  - slug: wallet-processes-remote-presentation-request
    internal_id: credimi.evidence.wallet.presentation.processes_remote_request.v1
  - slug: verifier-generates-valid-presentation-request
    internal_id: credimi.evidence.rp.verifier.generates_valid_presentation_request.v1
result_mapping:
  PASSED: pass
  FAILED: fail
```

---

## 5. Priority 3 — RP registration and entitlement checks

This is strategically important because of Implementing Regulation EU 2025/848.

### B-020 — RP register fetcher

Fetch human/machine-readable RP registration data.

Inputs:

- RP identifier
- register base URL or discovery config
- optional national profile config

Outputs:

### B-021 — RP entitlement parser

Parse RP entitlements from:

- national register entry
- RP registration certificate
- presentation request metadata
- WE BUILD mock register/list

Output normalized entitlement model:

```json

  "entitlements": [
    {
      "credential_type": "pid",
      "attribute": "age_over_18",
      "purpose": "age_verification",
      "legal_basis_or_scheme": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### B-022 — Presentation request vs entitlement matcher

```

---

## 11. Open questions to resolve with WE BUILD / Member States

1. What are the final machine-readable schemas for LoTL/TL/registers?
2. What signature/seal profile will be used: JAdES, XAdES, XMLDSig, JWS, other?

6. How are issuer/provider entitlements represented?
7. Which revocation mechanisms are mandatory or accepted?
8. How should sandbox/pilot lists be distinguished from production lists?
9. Are negative fixtures acceptable as evidence for wallet behavior?
10. Which external OpenID/WE BUILD test outputs are acceptable as assurance documentation?

---

## 12. Priority 9 — Qualified trust services / signature / seal / timestamp helpers

This section was added after reviewing the 2025 trust-service implementing acts uploaded later.
These helpers are mostly relevant to trust-helper work, external assurance evidence, and qualified-signature/seal/timestamp validation. They are **not** the first priority for real Wallet UI automation.

Credimi use cases:

- validating signed/sealed LoTL/TL material
- validating signed/sealed reports
- validating signed/sealed credential-related evidence
- validating qualified signature/seal evidence returned by third-party services

---

## 13. Open questions added by the 2025 trust-service acts

11. Will Credimi evidence bundles be timestamped with a qualified electronic time stamp, or only hashed/signed internally?
12. Do we need to validate qualified electronic signatures/seals directly, or is it enough to ingest validation reports from a qualified validation service?
13. Do WE BUILD / Member State trust-list signatures rely on ETSI AdES validation profiles, XMLDSig, JAdES, or another profile?
14. Will RP access/registration certificates reuse qualified certificate profile elements or separate wallet-specific profiles?
15. Is QERDS relevant to Credimi evidence delivery, or should it stay explicitly out of scope for now?
16. Should QTSP notification/conformity evidence be shown in Credimi as manual assurance evidence for issuers/verifiers using qualified services?

---

## Addendum v0.4 — eID assurance level evidence (EU 2015/1502)

The uploaded Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 defines the minimum technical specifications and procedures for assurance levels low, substantial and high for electronic identification means. It is relevant to Credimi mainly as certification / assurance documentation, not as a normal black-box wallet automation test.

### B-080 — eID scheme assurance-level evidence ingestion

Maps mainly to:

```text
wallet-eid-scheme-assurance-level-evidence
```

Inputs:

- eID scheme name / identifier
- claimed assurance level: low, substantial, high
- certification or conformity assessment report
- scheme documentation for enrolment, eID means management, authentication, management and organisation
- optional national notification / certified wallet list references

Output:

```json
{
  "claim_slug": "wallet-eid-scheme-assurance-level-evidence",
  "claim_title": "Wallet/eID scheme assurance level evidence is available",
  "result": "manual_review",
  "claimed_assurance_level": "high",
  "evidence": ["certification-assessment-report.pdf", "scheme-documentation.pdf"],
  "limitations": [
    "Credimi collects and maps assurance evidence; it does not itself determine notified eID assurance level."
  ]
}
```

### B-081 — Assurance-level checklist renderer

Render a reviewer-facing checklist based on the main 2015/1502 Annex categories:

- enrolment
- electronic identification means management
- authentication
- management and organisation

For each category, allow evidence attachment and review status:

```text
provided
missing
not_applicable
manual_review
```

This belongs in certification / assurance-support UX, not in the basic Maestro Action editor.

- device engagement;
- reader request;
- data retrieval;
- MSO / issuer data authentication;
- mDL authentication;
- reader authentication;
- session encryption result;
- online retrieval TLS/JWS result.

Evidence artifacts:

```text

# OpenID Conformance Suite EUDI subset addendum v1.1

## Source-scope rule

Do not ingest the whole OpenID Conformance Suite spec-link catalogue into EUDI artifacts.

Include as first-class EUDI/OpenID4VC sources:

```text
OID4VCI
OID4VP
HAIP / HAIPA
SD-JWT
SD-JWT VC
OAuth Status List
OpenID Federation
ISO 18013-7 reference-only
```

Include OAuth/OIDC dependencies only when directly used by a concrete EUDI test:

```text
PKCE
PAR
JAR
JARM
DPoP
JWT/JWK/JWA
OAuth AS Metadata
OIDC Discovery
OIDC Dynamic Client Registration
```

Exclude for now:

```text
FAPI
CIBA
Open Banking / regional profiles
CAEP / RISC / Shared Signals
AuthZEN
```

## B-180 — OID4VCI/OID4VP/HAIP reference adapter

Add helper metadata so every protocol helper can emit references using the same prefixes as the OpenID Conformance Suite.

## B-181 — Source-scope guard

Add a CI/build check that rejects accidental Tier 3/Tier 4 references unless explicitly whitelisted.
